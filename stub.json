The program should include the following functions:\n\n1. `get_guest_list()`: The main function to manage the guest list, allowing the user to add, delete, show, or upload guests from a file. It returns a list of guest dictionaries.\n\n2. `add_guest(guest_list)`: Adds a new guest to the guest list after checking for duplicates based on name or email.\n\n3. `delete_guest(guest_list)`: Deletes a guest from the guest list based on their name.\n\n4. `show_guests(guest_list)`: Displays all guests in the guest list.\n\n5. `upload_file(guest_list)`: Uploads a list of guests from a specified file, with each line containing a guest's name and email, separated by a comma.\n\n6. `save_guest_list(guest_list)`: Saves the guest list to a file named 'guest_list.txt'.\n\nInclude comments and error handling as necessary.","md5":"003a0a0f890d7a0ad504511ca2900612"},{"prompt":"Modify the existing Python program for managing a guest list to include the following features:\n\n1.
